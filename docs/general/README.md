# Introduction

**Welcome to Identity Chain Project :smile:**

## Use Case

### Common Scenarios for any Indy project

1. Onboarding    
    * Trust Anchors & Stewards
    * New Identity Holders
    
1. Schemas & Credential Definitions
   * Schemas define the credential attributes
   * Credential definitions are generated by Issuers using the schema and public/private keys

1. Attestation
    * After onboarding the identity holder requests and receives credentials

1. Verification
    * Identity holder generates cryptographic proof and relying party verifies it

1. Revocation
    * Issuer revokes credentials and proofs should not be valid anymore

### Identity Chain - Use Case

1. Government issues Passport Schema & Credential Definition
1. Government provides Passport credentials to citizens
1. Citizen can generate proof of a passport credential to KvK
1. Chamber of Commerce (KvK) verifies the proof is valid
1. KvK as a relying party and issuer of Company credentials
1. ING would verify the citizen owns a company and would allow the customer to open a commercial bank account
